# ABOUT MOONup

MOONup is a website created for a small group of amateur astronomers based in Cork city who wish to share their knowledge with as wide a range of people as possible. 
Astronomy can be appear intimidating to a novice, they'd like to change that.
They're focused on the moon because, as our nearest celestial neighbour, it's something everyone is familiar with, it's visible from most sites throughout the year
and can be enjoyed just by eye or a standard pair of binoculars. However they've found that the moon can be taken for granted, even by people who already have a passing interest in the night sky, but it doesn't take much to change that mindset. When viewed through a telescope the usual response is just: WOW! The aim of the website is to develop a community, build-up numbers and get lots of sign-ups to the newsletter. Over time the moonshots page will contain more pictures from attendees and from the various moonwatches, meet-ups and other events.

# WEBSITE OVERVIEW
I wanted to keep a simple, clean layout. I removed some headings above the fold section from my original wireframes as I thought it looked too busy on the page, especially when I started resizing to mobile screen sizes. I chose a colour scheme that complemented the lunar theme with whites and greys mainly but with a yellow, from the occasional yellow moon, to add a splash of colour and interest. This signature colour could be easily changed to suit any unusual lunar activity throughout the year e.g. when there's a blue or red moon.

<br>
<br>

# HOMEPAGE

![homepage](readme-images/moonup-homepage.png)

* The main page is an image of a full moon, animated so it zooms in to tie-in with the main heading's simple question that will hopefully intrigue and get the viewer to explore the rest of the page.
* The main heading is in a circular container to keep with the moon theme and the yellow is eye-catching against the white/grey/black lunar colour scheme.

# BUGS

## HAMBURGER MENU
* **EXPECTED** - on smaller screens the hamburger menu would appear and give links to the various pages when opened. 
* **TESTING** - launched website using terminal, tried various mobile screen sizes in web dev tools. 
* **RESULT** - once opened the hamburger menu links appeared underneath the main background images on each page.
* **FIX** - I added a Z-index to the hamburger menu to bring it to a level above the background images.

## SIGN-UP PAGE PHONE NUMBER PLACEHOLDER
* **EXPECTED** - placeholder text to show the required format to enter the phone number. I chose a 3 3 4 number format ([0-9]{3} [0-9]{3} [0-9]{4}) e.g 086 333 4444
* **TESTING** - launched website using terminal, tested the feature in web dev tools and on an iPhone X and Samsung S8.
* **RESULT** - I couldn't enter the number as required as there was no option to put spaces between the numbers on the phones I used.
* **FIX** - I changed the placeholder and required format to 10 digits without spaces ([0-9]{10} instead.

## WHITE TEXT APPEARS BOLDER ON DARK BACKGROUND
* **EXPECTED** - only difference was font/background colors between about moonup and about moonwatches section, wanted the font to have the same weight and size.
* **TESTING** - launched website using terminal, tested the feature in web dev tools at various screen sizes.
* **RESULT** - when scrolling through the website and between pages I noticed the white text on a grey background looked bolder. 
* **FIX** - from what I could find researching the problem it seems to be linked to font smoothing, may just be a Mac issue as well.
Screenshot below showing before and after -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; applied. Viewed using Chrome on iMac.
![font smoothing](readme-images/font-smoothing-chrome.png)

## CSS NOT DISPLAYING
* **EXPECTED** - the website to display with CSS applied to all pages.
* **TESTING** - launched website using terminal, tried navigating the website using the menu links.
* **RESULT** - a number of the pages were appearing without any CSS being applied.
* **FIX** - I checked the pages in question and saw they had absolute paths to the CSS file, changed links to relative paths.

## EMPHASIS TAGS NOT APPLYING
* **EXPECTED** - links with paragraph using inline <em></em> to appear italicised.
* **TESTING** - launched website using terminal, scrolled to the relevant section to see appearance.
* **RESULT** - the links didn't change to italic.
* **FIX** - created em {font-style: italic;} in CSS to correct.

## SVG LOGO NOT APPEARING
* **EXPECTED** - moonup svg logo to appear in top left of website in navigation menu bar.
* **TESTING** - launched website using terminal, scrolled to the relevant section to see appearance, tried multiple browsers.
* **RESULT** - on certain browsers the logo wasn't appearing.
* **FIX** - defined a height as well as width.

## PLACEHOLDER TEXT TOO FAINT
* **EXPECTED** - placeholder text used as guide to fill out the form to be subtle but legible. 
* **TESTING** - launched website using terminal, went to the relevant section to see appearance, tried multiple browsers.
* **RESULT** - because of the background and transparencies used the default placeholder text seemed too faint to my eyes.
* **FIX** - changed the colour of the placeholder using some code from w3schools. https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_placeholder.asp

## CENTERING ISSUE
* **EXPECTED** - the form on the sign-up page to be centered in the browser window on a desktop view.
* **TESTING** - launched website using terminal, went to the relevant section to see appearance, tried multiple browsers.
* **RESULT** - the form wasn't centering as I wanted it to.
* **FIX** - found this code when researching the problem: https://medium.com/swlh/how-well-do-you-know-css-52290217ff6e
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    margin-right: -50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%)

## MOBILE LANDSCAPE FORMAT
* **EXPECTED** - website to resize and look well on mobile screen sizes down to 360px width.
* **TESTING** - launched website using terminal, opened web dev tools, browsed through website to see appearance using various small screen mobile sizes.
* **RESULT** - working ok in portrait mode but the moonup homepage and opening page of moonwatches didn't fit well in landscape format.
* **FIX** - created a media query for small mobile screens in landscape format.

## SIGN-UP PAGE AT SMALL MOBILE SIZE
* **EXPECTED** - sign-up page form to resize to almost fit on a small mobile screen by using max width query.
* **TESTING** - launched website using terminal, opened web dev tools went to the relevant section to see appearance using small screen mobile sizes.
* **RESULT** - wasn't fitting as well as I'd hoped.
* **FIX** - created a new media query using max height instead of max width.

<br>

# KNOWN ISSUES

## WEBP IN OLDER BROWSERS

* As of June 23, 2020, all major browsers — Chrome, Edge, Firefox & Safari (14+) — support the WebP format but I've noticed that it doesn't work on older versions of MacOs/Safari. 
I was going to try and set up a fallback using jpgs for these older OSs. The picture tag was recommended as a solution e.g.

        <picture>
            <source type="image/webp" srcset="assets/images/full-moon-silhouetted-branches-david-dibert 720px.webp">
            <source type="image/jpg" srcset="assets/images/full-moon-silhouetted-branches-david-dibert.jpg">
            <img src="assets/images/full-moon-silhouetted-branches-david-dibert.jpg"  type="image/jpg" alt="dark black sky with large full moon with silhouetted tree branches by david dibert">
          </picture>    

* I had some difficulty getting it to work though, with the jpg over-riding the webp in all instances. I discussed with a Code Institute Tutor and they suggested just sticking with webp as: There has to come a point where older browsers aren't developed for anymore and webp has been around for some time now. Most of the world is using a Chromium based browser or Firefox.

## CSS CODE

* Given more time I would have like to severely edit my CSS code to make it leaner and remove any unused code.

<br>
<br>
<br>

# CREDITS

* Thanks to the Code Institute Tutors who helped me. Oisín and Scott for their advice on a couple of issues and Ger for fixing a Gitpod/Github sync problem.
* Thanks to Kera Cudmore for her talk and pointers on creating README files.
* Big thank you to my CI Mentor, Mitko Bachvarov, for his support, excellent advice and eagle eye for detail.

<br>
<br>
<br>

# CONTENT

The paras on Binoculars and Telescopes on the moonwatches page were taken from the NASA website section on observing the moon.

<br>

# CODE

## LOVE RUNNING
* I based a lot of the layout on the Code Institute Love Running initially. I changed the hero zoom slightly to better suit what I wanted.
* I moved away from the Floats to a Flex model which seemed to work better for me especially when making the site responsive. Thanks again to CI Tutor, Oisin,
for pointing me in that direction to fix a centering issue. 
* I found this youtube video by Luke Peters very instructive as well with regard to responsive columns: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pcMxrugSbs 

## HAMBURGER MENU CODE
https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/hamburger-menu-css/

* This was an excellent run-through of various style and options. I adapted one of them so it extended a bit further into the page and didn't partially block my logo
Also amended the colours and removed some lines.

## WHITE TEXT APPEARS BOLDER
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14477265/css-white-text-on-black-background-looks-bolder

body {
-moz-font-smoothing: antialiased;
-o-font-smoothing: antialiased;
-moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}

* I found the above or variations thereof in a few places but used the one from a stackoverflow chat. The last one of the four is the one that seems to work.


## CENTERING ISSUE
https://medium.com/swlh/how-well-do-you-know-css-52290217ff6e

    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    margin-right: -50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%)

* I had some hassle with centering on the sign-up page, used the above code to fix the problem. 

## TABLE OF CONTENTS
* <small><i><a href='http://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/'>Table of contents generated with markdown-toc</a></i></small>

## PLACEHOLDER
Changed the colour of the placeholder using some code from w3schools, adapted to suit my colour palette.
