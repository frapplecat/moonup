# ABOUT MOONup

MOONup is a website created for a small group of amateur astronomers based in Cork city who wish to share their knowledge with as wide a range of people as possible. 
Astronomy can be appear intimidating to a novice, they'd like to change that.
They're focused on the moon because, as our nearest celestial neighbour, it's something everyone is familiar with, it's visible from most sites throughout the year
and can be enjoyed just by eye or a standard pair of binoculars. However they've found that the moon can be taken for granted, even by people who already have a passing interest in the night sky, but it doesn't take much to change that mindset. When viewed through a telescope the usual response is just: WOW! The aim of the website is to develop a community, build-up numbers and get lots of sign-ups to the newsletter. Over time the moonshots page will contain more pictures from attendees and from the various moonwatches, meet-ups and other events.

# WEBSITE OVERVIEW
I wanted to keep a simple, clean layout. I removed some headings above the fold section from my original wireframes as I thought it looked too busy on the page, especially when I started resizing to mobile screen sizes. I chose a colour scheme that complemented the lunar theme with whites and greys mainly but with a yellow, from the occasional yellow moon, to add a splash of colour and interest. This signature colour could be easily changed to suit any unusual lunar activity throughout the year e.g. when there's a blue or red moon.

![colour scheme change screenshot2](readme-images/blood-moon-example.png)

<br>
<br>

# LOGO & HEADINGS
* I created the logo and headings in Adobe Illustrator, outlined the Rubik Moonrocks font, and exported as .svg

<br>
<br>
<br>

# HOMEPAGE

![homepage](readme-images/homepage.png)

* The main page is an image of a full moon, animated so it zooms in to tie-in with the main heading's simple question that will hopefully intrigue and get the viewer to explore the rest of the page.
* The main heading is in a circular container to keep with the moon theme and the yellow is eye-catching against the white/grey/black lunar colour scheme.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## ABOUT MOONUP SECTION

![about moonup](readme-images/about-moonup.png)
 
* The about MOONup section will briefly explain the groups goals, where they meet, what's needed for an attendee.

# BUGS

* In the sign-up section the phone number field has a placeholder showing the format required for entry. Had a 3 3 4 ([0-9]{3} [0-9]{3} [0-9]{4}) format initially 
but on some mobiles the spaces weren't allowed so switched to 0000000000 ([0-9]{10}) instead.


* The white text on #3a3a3a background seemed bolder in certain browsers. From what I could find researching the problem it seems to be linked to font smoothing, may just be a mac issue as well.
Screenshot below showing before and after -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased; applied.
Viewed using Chrome on iMac.

![font smoothing](readme-images/font-smoothing-chrome.png)

* As of June 23, 2020, all major browsers — Chrome, Edge, Firefox & Safari (14+) — support the WebP format but I've noticed that it doesn't work on older versions of MacOs/Safari. I was going to try and set up a fallback using jpgs for these older OSs. The picture tag was recommended as a solution e.g.

        <picture>
            <source type="image/webp" srcset="assets/images/full-moon-silhouetted-branches-david-dibert 720px.webp">
            <source type="image/jpg" srcset="assets/images/full-moon-silhouetted-branches-david-dibert.jpg">
            <img src="assets/images/full-moon-silhouetted-branches-david-dibert.jpg"  type="image/jpg" alt="dark black sky with large full moon with silhouetted tree branches by david dibert">
          </picture>    

I had some difficulty getting it to work though, with the jpg over-riding the webp in all instances. I discussed with a Code Institute Tutor and they suggested just sticking with webp as: There has to come a point where older browsers aren't developed for anymore and webp has been around for some time now. Most of the world is using a Chromium based browser or Firefox.

* I had some hassle with centering on the sign-up page, used the code below to fix the problem. 
https://medium.com/swlh/how-well-do-you-know-css-52290217ff6e

    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    margin-right: -50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%)

* I noticed my MOONup.svg logo wasn't displaying on Firefox and Safari. Fixed by defining the height.

* The hamburger menu was opening underneath the hero images on each page. Fixed by giving a z-index to the item.

* The placeholder text was very faint in some of the fields on the signup page. Changed the colour of the placeholder using some code from w3schools.
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_placeholder.asp

* Couldn't get signup page to fit neatly on a range of mobile screens. I was trying to eliminate the need for much if any scrolling to the footer by using max-width queries.
Added max-height queries to help resolve it. It worked but led to the form position moving a fraction and overlaying the logo slightly. Add a small position change to the
max-height query in question to compensate.

* Used <em></em> tags to highlight some links within para content, noticed they weren't working on certain browsers. Applied em {font-style: italic;} in CSS to correct.

# CREDITS

* Thanks to Code Institute Tutors Oisín and Scott for their advice on a couple of issues.
* Thanks to Kera Cudmore for her talk on creating README files
* Big thank you to my CI Mentor, Mitko Bachvarov, for his support, excellent advice and eagle eye for detail.

# CONTENT

The paras on Binoculars and Telescopes on the moonwatches page were taken from the NASA website section on observing the moon.

# CODE

## LOVE RUNNING
* I based a lot of the layout on the Code Institute Love Running initially. I changed the hero zoom slightly to better suit what I wanted.
* I moved away from the Floats to a Flex model which seemed to work better for me especially when making the site responsive. Thanks again to CI Tutor, Oisin,
for pointing me in that direction to fix a centering issue. 
* I found this youtube video by Luke Peters very instructive as well with regard to responsive columns: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pcMxrugSbs 

## HAMBURGER MENU CODE
https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/hamburger-menu-css/

* This was an excellent run-through of various style and options. I adapted one of them so it extended a bit further into the page and didn't partially block my logo
Also amended the colours and removed some lines.

## WHITE TEXT APPEARS BOLDER
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14477265/css-white-text-on-black-background-looks-bolder

body {
-moz-font-smoothing: antialiased;
-o-font-smoothing: antialiased;
-moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
}

* I found the above or variations thereof in a few places but used the one from a stackoverflow chat. The last one of the four is the one that seems to work.


## CENTERING ISSUE

    top: 50%;
