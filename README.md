# About MoonUp

MoonUp is a website created for a small group of amateur astronomers based in Cork city who wish to share their knowledge with as wide a range of people as possible.

# Website Features
I wanted to keep a nice and clean layout. I chose a colour scheme that complemented the lunar theme with whites and greys mainly but with the yellow, from the occasional yellow moon, to add a pop of colour and interest. This signature colour could be easily changed to suit any unusual lunar activity throughout the year e.g.
the occasional blue moon or red moon.
