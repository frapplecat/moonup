# About MoonUp

MoonUp is a website created for a small group of amateur astronomers based in Cork city who wish to share their knowledge with as wide a range of people as possible. 
Parts of astromomy and the night sky are a quite niche or exclusive hobby to many people and can be appear intimidating to a novice, we'd like to change that.
We're focused on the moon becuase, as our nearest celestial neighbour, it's something everyone is familiar with and it's visible from any site thoughout the year
and can be enjoyed just by eye or a standard pair of binoculars. We've found that the moon can be taken for granted even by people who already have a passing interest in the
night sky but it deosn't take much to change that mindset. When viewed through a telescope the usual response is just: WOW! The aim of the website is to hopefully develop
a community, build up numbers and get lots of sign-up to the newsletter. Overtime the moon-shots page will contain more pictures from attendees and from the various moon watches
and over meet-ups.

# Website Features
I wanted to keep a nice and clean layout. I removed some headings from my original above the fold section wireframes as I thought it looked too busy on the page, especially when I started resizing to mobile screen sizes. I chose a colour scheme that complemented the lunar theme with whites and greys mainly but with a yellow, from the occasional yellow moon, to add a pop of colour and interest. This signature colour could be easily changed to suit any unusual lunar activity throughout the year e.g. when there's a blue or red moon.

## Homepage

The main page is an images of the full moon, animated so it zooms in to tie in with the main heading's simple question that will hopefully intrigue and get the viewer to explore the rest of the page.
The main heading is in a circular container to keep with the moon theme and the yellow is eyecatching against the white/grey/black lunar colour scheme.
